# godot-pipewire

Bindings for Pipewire to allow for capture of video sources within Godot.

Created with the intent of forwarding content into Godot, similar to [Spout](https://github.com/erodozer/spout-gd) in Windows, so that applications may appear within virtual environments.  Use cases for such capability include VR/AR virtual desktops and streaming overlays.

## Disclaimer
This project is heavily WIP, and might not even be possible based on the state of Godot's Rust bindings.
I am incredibly new to Rust and Pipewire, trying to get any of this working is a feat beyond my limited understanding, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
